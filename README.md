ðŸ›’ Supermarket Management Application
Overview
The Supermarket Management application is a project designed to efficiently manage a supermarket. The application is built using C#, the WPF framework, and SQL Server for the database. The architecture follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
